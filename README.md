# bee_pytorch_learning

### An Image Active Learning framework and Graphical User Interface

This project leverages PyTorch and PySimpleGUI to build a user-friendly approach to training transfer learning image machine learning models. 

Supports both Machine labeling and Supervisor labeling of images through their respective pop-up windows.

Built-in support for training:
 * Alexnet
 * Resnet50
 * Mobilenet V3
 * VGG19

### Getting Started

Clone the main branch into a directory on your computer and navigate to `src` inside the `bee_pytorch_learning` directory. run `python3 main.py` for the GUI to appear!

NOTE: Support for a python executable as well as a dependency list to build a conda environment will be available soon.
